- BEST PERFORMING: 2 Layers of Conv2D + MaxPool
	- Adding 3rd layer reduced accuracy
	- Number of filters in convolution matters (64 produced good results)

- Dropout not worth without large amount of previous layers
	- If set isn't already overtrained, just reduces accuracy

- Adding extra hidden Dense layer can help increase accuracy

- Settings mostly change three things:
	- Rate of growth over epochs
	- Maximum achieveable accuracy
	- Overtraining amount

- Larger amount of epochs possibly better with dropout implemented
